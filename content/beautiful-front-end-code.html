    <h2><span>Beautiful</span> Front End Code</h2>
    <h3 class="tagline">with Backbone and Coffeescript</h3>

    <p>This 2-day intensive course will forever <strong>change the way you develop</strong> the
      front end of your web applications.  Too long, many web developers have
      approached our front end code as drudgery or worse.  No more!  We'll
      help you build the skills to write front end code you can love every
      bit as much as your server side code.  This course is designed for
      developers who have a basic understanding of javascript and building
      web applications (ideally but not necessarily in ruby on rails) and
      want their front end code to be a thing of beauty.  We'll cover the
      following:</p>

    <h3>Jasmine</h3>

    <p>Before you can even begin to write good front end code, you need to
      treat it with the same loving care as your back end code.  Of course,
      this means Test (or Behavior) Driven Development, and Jasmine is the
      framework of choice here.  Will dig in and give you a thorough
      understanding of Jasmine, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>matchers</li>
      <li>spies and mocks</li>
      <li>working with jquery and the DOM</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Coffeescript</h3>

    <p>This "little language that compiles into JavaScript" has a truly lovely
      syntax for exposing all the awesome than was hiding in javascript the whole
      time.  We'll expllore all the features that let you shed the noise and let
      the intent of your code come shining through.  We'll cover:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Installation</li>
      <li>language features</li>
      <li>integration with exiting JS frameworks</li>
      <li>debugging</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backbone.js</h3>

    <p>Beautiful is well organized code with a clear separation of concerns, and
      backbone.js gives our front end code a place for everything, with
      everything in it's place.  In this part of of the course, we'll learn
      backbone by doing.  We'll gradually build a rich client web application
      (with jasmine specs of course) that gives a chance to use all the pieces of
      backbone.js, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Views</li>
      <li>Handlebars templates</li>
      <li>Models</li>
      <li>Controllers</li>
      <li>Integration with server side code</li>
    </ul>
