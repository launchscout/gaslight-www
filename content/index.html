	  <h3>Who is Gaslight Software?</h3>
	  <h4>A Cincinnati based Software Development Cooperative</h4>
	  <p>Gaslight Software is a group of independent developers who have formed a strong
            bond of trust through many years of close association.  We are formalizing our ad hoc
            relationship into a single working entity that can focus on delivering consistent results.</p>
	  <h4>Highly Skilled Developers</h4>
	  <p>Each of us has honed our craft through practical application. We've grown with the industry. 
            We have a history of multiple languages, environments and a mastery of the best technologies.</p>
	  <h4>Leading Agile Practitioners</h4>
	  <p>Yes, we've read the books.  Some of us have even had some training. More than that, we've
            lived agile projects. We've been on agile teams.  We've led agile teams.  We've introduced agile
            to big organizations. We've been there and done that so many times our whole wardrobe is made
            up of agile tee shirts.</p>
          <p>More than just doing, we're leading the way.  You'll see us presenting in local users' groups.  
            You'll see us presenting at national conferences. You can read our writings and see how we're
            thinking and shaping our industry around us.</p>
	  <p>Let us put all this experience to work for you.  We're not just made up of trendy buzzwords.
            We know what works. We know how to make software projects successful. We can help make
            your project successful.</p>
